First Version: 1.0.0.0
Current Version: 1.0.0.0
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Thanks for downloading RobloxOS, I hope you enjoy experiencing the first version of it.
Before you open any of those setup files, let me explain what they do.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Files:
dotNetFx40_Full_x86_x64.exe --Installs .NET Framework 4.0 (required if you want to run this on Windows XP for whatever reason)
robloxOSsetup.msi --Helps you install RobloxOS on your computer

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you are going to install this on a Windows XP machine then it is recommended that you run 'dotNetFx40_Full_x86_x64.exe' before
running 'robloxOSsetup.msi', By the way, Windows XP is the oldest Operating System you can install RobloxOS on.
